      I am a mathematician with a PhD from Trinity College Dublin and a
      Licenciatura from the University of Buenos Aires. I worked as a researcher
      in MPIMiS Leipzig and later in Humboldt Universität. An algebraist by
      trade, I am broadly interested in analysis, algebra and combinatorics,
      among others. On the side of financial mathematics, I am interested in the
      computational and implementation aspects (in particular AAD), and recently
      started dwelling in stochastic optimization. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work in model risk management in Deutsche Bank, where I am a
      model validation lead in the Berlin team for validation of interest rate
      and forex pricing models. I have also worked with several reserve models
      for various XVA charges. You may know me from <a
      href="https://math.stackexchange.com/" class="underline">math.SE</a>,
      where I am a moderator. <a href="images/Picture.jpg"
      class="underline">Here</a> is a picture of myself.

    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>
       I completed my PhD in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin under the
       direction of
      <a href="https://irma.math.unistra.fr/~dotsenko/"
      class="underline">Vladimir Dotsenko</a>. My dissertation is available <a
      href="https://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/96487"
      class="underline">here</a>. I completed my undergraduate studies at the
      University of Buenos Aires, and wrote my thesis under the direction of <a
      href="https://mate.dm.uba.ar/~aldoc9/" class="underline">Mariano</a>
      Suárez-Álvarez.
    </p>

    <h2 id="pricer">Online pricer</h2>

    I have developed a Monte Carlo pricer with automatic adjoint differentiation
    in Go, and aim to include a small UI to price with the stochastic volatility
    Heston model in 2026 Q1. See below for some snippets of price, delta and vega of a
    European call generated with this Monte Carlo pricer for the Heston model
    with and without stochastic volatility (in which case the model is the usual 
    Black--Scholes model).

    <h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>

    Starting 2026, I aim to make monthly blog posts about things I am or have learned around 
    mathematical finance and computational finance. Stay tuned!

    <h2 id="repos">Repositories</h2>
    I have some tiny repositories with simple computations that someone 
    just starting with financial mathematics may be interested in:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Try <a href="https://github.com/ptamarov/tree_pricing">this repo</a> for
        the basics about tree pricing models.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try <a href="https://github.com/ptamarov/lsmc_py">this repo</a> for
        least-squares Monte Carlo pricing of American options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try <a href="https://github.com/ptamarov/rationalvol">this repo</a> to
        learn about Jaeckel's industrial quality method to imply Black--Scholes
        volatility from price quotes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="past">Past activity</h2>
    <p>
      I was a postdoctoral researcher in the research group of
      <a
      href="https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/forschungsgebiete/mathematische-physik/borot-mp-homepage/copy_of_borot-fp">Gaetan
      Borot</a>. I supervised the <em>Bachelorarbeit</em> of Lea Polonyi
      (Physics). Lea successfully defended her thesis titled "Cluster Algebras"
      on January 30th 2024. The referees were Gaetan Borot and <a
      href="https://www2.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~ortega/">Ángela Ortega</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was part of the organizing committee of the 2023 <a
        href="https://www.cimpa.info/">CIMPA</a> School
        <em>Crossroads of geometry, representation theory and higher
        structures</em>, which took place from March 13th to March 26th 2023 in
        Puerto Madryn, Argentina, and which was a great success. More
        information available
        <a href="https://crossroads-2023.github.io/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a
        href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/members.html">non-linear algebra
        research group</a>
        of the MPIMiS in Leipzig from May 2021 to March 2022. During my stay
        there, I gave a lecture series titled <em>Algebraic operads, Koszul
        duality and Gröbner bases: an introduction</em>
      from October 15th 2021 to January, 21st 2022. More
